## üå∏ Sakhi-Svasthy

A women-centric health and wellness platform designed to empower women with easy access to medical resources, health tracking, and awareness tools.

## üìú Description

Sakhi-Svasthy is a digital health solution focused on providing women with a safe, supportive, and accessible platform for managing their physical and mental well-being.
The project was built with the motivation to address the lack of dedicated healthcare platforms for women, where they can not only track health records but also find guidance, awareness, and community support.

It aims to solve problems such as:
Limited awareness of women‚Äôs health issues in rural and urban areas.
Difficulty in accessing personalized healthcare resources.
Lack of digital platforms combining education, tracking, and doctor consultation for women.
